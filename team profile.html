        <lable for style = "font-size: 20px;">Nguyen Nhu Xuan Nguyen (S3922415)</lable><br>
        <lable for>Because his high school did not offer an IT subject, he is still a freshman in information technology. He learned a little Python in "Intro to programming" last semester, and Intro to IT is a good course for him now. His hobbies are reading a book and hanging out with a friend. He like IT because when he was young, he found that the coder is very cool and smart, and he wanted to try new things.

        <lable for>About group working, because of poor communication, we have to separate group 25 into 2 different groups, and the project does not go well because there are only 2 people in group 26, so the project outcome is not good. However, with only 2 people, we were still satisfied with our final product. </lable>

        <br>
        <lable for>There are 2 people in this group so we will talk about our career plans. For Nguyen, he is still confused about which is the ideal job between security and website developer. Security is attractive to him, but he also wants to develop a website with his knowledge and imagination. Different from Nguyen, An wants to become a database manager. they have different ideal workspaces too, so there is only 1 similar between these ideal jobs is they both learn in the same major in the same university RMIT </lable>
